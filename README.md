# üì∞ News API with YARP Reverse Proxy

This project implements a news-related web and mobile application backend using .NET 8, following Clean Architecture principles. The solution is built with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and clean code practices.

## üìê Architecture

### Clean Architecture
The application is structured following Clean Architecture, promoting a clear separation of concerns. The solution is divided into core layers:

#### Domain: 
Contains the core business logic and entities.
#### Application: 
Handles all business rules using CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with the MediatR library.
#### Infrastructure: 
Includes database access (EF Core), external services
#### API: 
Exposes the application‚Äôs functionalities as REST endpoints.
#### YARP Reverse Proxy: 
Utilizes YARP to route API requests efficiently, with RoundRobin load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple API instances.

### CQRS with MediatR
The project implements CQRS with the MediatR pattern. This pattern separates read and write operations, improving performance, scalability, and maintainability. MediatR is used to handle commands and queries in a decoupled and testable manner.

### Result Pattern
To improve error handling and ensure consistent responses, the Result pattern is utilized throughout the application. This allows for clear and descriptive error messages, reducing ambiguity and making the API more user-friendly.
